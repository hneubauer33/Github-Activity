Once upon a time there was girl who wanted to have many plants. She wanted nothing but to have tons and tons of plants surrounding her.
So one day she went ot the plant store and asked the manager what kind of plants she should buy. However, the manager was not just a manager,
he was the plant protector of all the plants, and he needed to make sure that she was suitable to own a plant. So, he sent her to a far off land
so that she could learn the way of plant owning. She gardned, and she cultivated, and she learned and learned and learned all about plants.
After a year of learning she went back to the store and noticed that the man had vanished. She saw a small note on the edge of his desk. It read
"dear girl, it has been a long time coming but I needed to find my replacement so that I could retire to flordia and own a condeminian. You are now
the plant protector. Have a decent time." And from then on out, she protected all of the plants and was surrounded by plants just like she dreamed would
happen.
